Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) is the field of study of how to perform NLP tasks on quantum hardware (Lorenz et al., 2023). Subword tokenization is a problem that is particularly important in the field of NLP. It is the task of splitting up a text into common character clusters for the purpose of allowing a model to maintain a reasonable vocabulary size while being able to learn representations of tokens and process unknown words into known subword tokens (2024). In this paper, I present a novel implementation of how to perform subword tokenization of English words using a quantum-based system. The system works fairly well in comparison to other common tokenization algorithms such as Unigram SentencePiece, Morfessor, and Byte-Pair Encoding. The motivation behind this is furthering the field of QNLP as well as attempting to generate another system for tokenizing text.
