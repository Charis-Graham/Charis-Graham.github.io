<h1>BestBot</h1> 

Welcome to our Hack 112 submission BestBot, an application that focuses on emphasizing the importance of taking care of yourself :) 

The premis of this application is to display how an individual's daily actions impact their health and wellbeing using a virtual robot simulation. You will need to run main.py to see the features of this app.

<h3>Our application prompts a series of questions to the user asking the following questions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>How are you?</li>
<li>How much have you eaten today?</li>
<li>Have you drunk water today?</li>
<li>How much have you slept today?</li>
<li>Have you exercised today?</li>
<li>Have you spent time with friends or family today?</li>
<li>Have you gone outside today?</li>
<li>Have you meditated today?</li>
</ol>

The user can answer a question with just the simple click of a button. Some of the answers can be a simple "yes" or "no", while other answers have multiple ranges to select from. Every answer comes with an amount of "People Points" which are points added to a score to determine how the robot appears on the screen.

<h3>When a robot recieves feedback that indicates direction towards optimal health, some visual changes include:</h3>

<li>Sparkles in the background</li>
<li>Happy background color</li>
<li>Heart changes to a vibrant color</li>
<li>Smiling face</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Happy background starts to fade</li>
<li>Neutral facial expression</li>
<li>Heart color fades</li>
<li>Background can turn into a more "depressing" color.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Incorporating suggestions about how a user could incorporate more healthy habits into their lives</li>
<li>When a user is making great decisions, display facts that tell them how their actions are improving their lives</li>
</ol>

<h3>Bug</h3>
Multiple buttons can be clicked per row... working to fix this eventually.
