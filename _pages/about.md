Hi! My name is Charis Graham, and I’m a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Language Technologies. My passion for programming has been with me for years, starting with building simple computer games using the block-based visual programming language Scratch. In high school, I joined the Computer Science career pathway, but it wasn’t until my internship at Caltech during the summer between my junior and senior years that I truly found my calling. There, I worked with leading experts in quantum computing on a project involving quantum chess, and that experience inspired me to pursue a lifelong career in coding.

When I was accepted into CMU, I was thrilled but also a bit overwhelmed. I was stepping into the vast and complex world of Computer Science, a field that spans everything from security to machine learning to game engineering. Although my initial interest in CS stemmed from game development, I soon realized it wasn’t my true passion. I loved coding, but I hadn’t yet discovered what I wanted to do with it. That changed during the fall of my sophomore year when I took an introductory class in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I was immediately captivated. The idea of analyzing textual data computationally using probabilistic models, the brilliance of transformer models, and the incredible range of NLP applications left me in awe. It was clear—this was my passion, and it was the path I wanted to pursue in computer science.

Since then, I’ve taken a linguistic or machine learning-related class every semester, diving deeper into how statistics and machine learning can be used to model language. My interest has grown even further to encompass the full breadth of machine learning. I’ve been especially drawn to the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of fields, from linguistics to astronomy. Last summer, I interned on a project studying emergent languages—researching how models can create their own languages to communicate. That experience solidified my desire to focus on machine learning and natural language processing in my future career.
